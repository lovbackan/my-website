# First website
Before I started web development at YRGO I had no experience with code but luckily I had some friends that already were working as developers. So to get some experience before the admission test for YRGO, I had some help from my friend to show me some of the ropes to build a basic website with Javasscript, HTML and CSS. This site is only made to make you laugh and reminisce about the early days of the web which were crazy and fun.
